SPRINT 59 S59-01 COMMIT A: ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW COMPLETE
========================================================

COMMIT: feat(metrics): Add workspace_id label plumbing for multi-tenant scoping
HASH: 9daeadb
BRANCH: sprint-59/s59-01-metrics-workspace
REVIEW DATE: 2025-10-16

APPROVAL DECISION: APPROVED - READY TO MERGE
=============================================

SUMMARY
-------
Commit A provides a well-designed foundation for multi-tenant metrics observability.
The implementation is conservative (flag-gated, disabled by default), cardinality-aware
(allowlist enforcement), and properly decoupled from Commit B orchestrator integration.

KEY METRICS
-----------
- Tests: 28 total, 28 passing (100% pass rate)
- Coverage: Format validation (13 tests), flag behavior (5 tests), backward compatibility (10 tests)
- Code Quality: Linting clean (black, ruff), full type hints, comprehensive docstrings
- Performance: No impact to existing code paths
- Security: Format validation + allowlist enforcement prevents injection/DoS

ARCHITECTURE FINDINGS
---------------------
CRITICAL: NONE
HIGH: NONE
MEDIUM: 1 (intentional design: parameters accepted but not used until Commit B wires them)
LOW: NONE

POSITIVE FINDINGS:
- Design Pattern: Flag-gating + cardinality-first approach consistent with existing patterns
- Cardinality Bounds: O(50 × 3 × 2) = ~300 additional series with 50 workspaces (acceptable)
- Workspace Isolation: Clear contract aligned with Sprint 57-58 multi-tenant concepts
- Incremental Design: Clean separation between Commit A (plumbing) and Commit B (wiring)
- Future Extensibility: Foundation supports Sprint 60+ sampling, reconciliation, hierarchical labels
- Integration Points: Clear and well-defined for Commit B orchestrator integration

FILES CHANGED
-------------
+ src/telemetry/prom.py (+56 lines)
  - is_workspace_label_enabled() function
  - canonical_workspace_id() validator
  - Updated record_queue_job() signature
  - Updated record_action_execution() signature

+ tests/test_workspace_metrics.py (+200 lines)
  - 28 comprehensive tests

CARDINALITY ANALYSIS
--------------------
Baseline (no workspace_id): ~300-400 series
With workspace_id (50 workspaces): ~9,300 total series
Prometheus memory estimate: ~1 KB per series = 9.3 MB overhead (acceptable)
Risk level: LOW (mitigated by allowlist enforcement)

SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE
-------------------
1. Flag-gating: METRICS_WORKSPACE_LABEL=off (default) - disabled by default
2. Format validation: ^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$ - prevents injection
3. Allowlist enforcement: METRICS_WORKSPACE_ALLOWLIST env var - caps cardinality
4. Optional parameters: Backward compatible, no breaking changes
5. Type safety: Full Python 3.10+ type hints

TESTING COVERAGE
----------------
TestWorkspaceLabelFlag (5 tests):
  - Disabled by default behavior
  - Enabled/disabled flag parsing
  - Case-insensitive handling

TestWorkspaceIdValidation (13 tests):
  - Format validation (valid/invalid formats)
  - Allowlist enforcement
  - Whitespace handling
  - Edge cases (empty, None, max length)

TestRecordQueueJobWithWorkspace (4 tests):
  - Signature acceptance
  - Backward compatibility
  - None handling

TestRecordActionExecutionWithWorkspace (6 tests):
  - Signature acceptance
  - Backward compatibility
  - Status variations
  - None handling

INTEGRATION NOTES
-----------------
Action Adapters (google.py, microsoft.py):
  - Already receive workspace_id in execute() methods
  - Commit B adds one parameter to ~4 calls per adapter
  - No schema changes needed

Queue Backends:
  - Needs investigation in Commit B
  - Likely in orchestrator/scheduler.py
  - Commit B identifies and wires workspace_id

Prometheus Config:
  - prometheus-recording.yml needs workspace aggregation rules in Commit B
  - No breaking changes to existing alerts

SECURITY POSTURE
-----------------
Metrics Label Injection: SECURE
  - Multiple validation layers prevent special characters
  - Allowlist prevents unexpected values

Cardinality DoS: MITIGATED
  - Off by default
  - Admin-controlled via environment
  - Cardinality bounds documented

Workspace Privacy: DEPENDS ON DEPLOYMENT
  - Metrics are per-provider (no user-level PII)
  - Requires Prometheus access control in deployment

PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS
------------------------
Commit A (this commit):
  - No performance impact
  - Validators are O(32) or O(m) where m=allowlist size
  - No changes to metric recording hot path

Commit B (orchestrator integration):
  - One additional parameter pass-through (negligible)
  - Expected overhead: <1% latency per action execution

Recommendations
- Include baseline latency test in Commit B to verify <1% overhead
- Start canary rollout with small allowlist (5-10 workspaces)
- Monitor Prometheus memory during gradual expansion

MERGE RECOMMENDATION
--------------------
APPROVED - Ready to merge with conditions:

Pre-Merge:
1. Commit message must reference Sprint 59-01 Commit A and Commit B plan
2. Add Prometheus best practices link in prom.py docstring

Post-Merge (for Commit B):
1. Create integration checklist with specific file targets
2. Document cardinality monitoring approach
3. Define canary rollout thresholds

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Merge Commit A to main
2. Begin Commit B implementation (plumbing + testing)
3. Sprint 59 Week 1: Complete and test Commit B
4. Sprint 59 Week 2: Canary rollout with small allowlist
5. Sprint 59 Week 3+: Gradual expansion and optimization

EXIT CRITERIA - ALL MET
-----------------------
[x] Architecture is sound and extensible
[x] Cardinality safeguards are well-designed
[x] Workspace isolation contract is clear
[x] Design properly supports Commit B orchestrator integration
[x] Scalable foundation for Sprint 59+ work
[x] Ready to merge and proceed to Commit B
