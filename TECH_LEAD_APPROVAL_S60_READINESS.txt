TECH LEAD APPROVAL: PR #42 - Sprint 60 Readiness Assessment
================================================================================

DATE: 2025-10-17
BRANCH: feat/rollout-infrastructure
PR: #42 (AI Orchestrator v0.1 + S59-05 Hotfix)
REVIEWER: Claude Code (Tech Lead)

================================================================================
FINAL VERDICT: GO (with documented conditions)
================================================================================

RATING: GOOD
CONFIDENCE: 95%
BASELINE: v0.1.4 - APPROVED for Sprint 60 Phase 1

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS (9 Items)
================================================================================

FINDING 1: S59-05 Hotfix Correctly Classified as Temporary
  Status: APPROVED ✓
  Evidence: Lines 1512-1514 (webapi.py) explicitly mark as temporary
  Migration: Dual-write path is clear and unblocked
  Risk: NONE - hotfix is bridge, not pattern

FINDING 2: Redis Key Schema Supports Dual-Write Migration
  Status: APPROVED ✓
  Current: ai:job:{job_id} with workspace_id in hash fields
  Future: Will support ai:job:{workspace_id}:{job_id}
  Risk: NONE - no tight coupling, SimpleQueue is swappable

FINDING 3: Workspace Validation Layer is Excellent
  Status: APPROVED ✓
  Security: Uses fullmatch() (prevents injection)
  Isolation: Pure validation function, no side effects
  Cardinality: Flag-gated + allowlist prevents explosion

FINDING 4: Permission Layer is Intentionally Simple
  Status: APPROVED ✓
  Design: Allowlist-only, forward-compatible
  Future: Extensible for per-workspace rules in S60+
  Risk: NONE - correct v0.1 scope

FINDING 5: Telemetry is Safe-by-Default
  Status: APPROVED ✓
  Flag: METRICS_WORKSPACE_LABEL=off (default)
  Allowlist: Optional METRICS_WORKSPACE_ALLOWLIST enforcement
  Risk: NONE - production-safe

FINDING 6: Test Coverage is Comprehensive
  Status: APPROVED ✓
  Total: 60 tests (22 jobs + 38 workspace metrics)
  Isolation: FakeRedis, fixture cleanup, no external deps
  Testability: Cursor pagination, workspace filtering, PII redaction

FINDING 7: Layer Boundaries are Clean
  Status: APPROVED ✓
  Auth → Validation → Data Access → Orchestration
  Circular Dependencies: NONE
  Tight Coupling: NONE

FINDING 8: PII Redaction is Conservative
  Status: APPROVED ✓
  Redacted: Params (user input, contains secrets)
  Included: Result (action output, pre-filtered)
  Strategy: Correct for v0.1

FINDING 9: Idempotency Design is Sound
  Status: APPROVED ✓
  Key: ai:idempotency:{workspace_id}:{client_request_id}
  TTL: 24 hours (matches job retention)
  Risk: NONE - production-ready

================================================================================
SPRINT 60 MIGRATION READINESS
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE (Sprint 59):
  - Redis schema: ai:job:{job_id} (workspace_id in hash)
  - Read path: SCAN ai:job:*, filter in app layer
  - Performance: Requires limit * 2 buffer for workspace filtering

S60 PHASE 1 (Dual-Write Foundation):
  - Write path: Store to BOTH old + new schemas
  - Read path: Still use old schema with app filtering
  - Feature flag: AI_JOBS_NEW_SCHEMA=off
  - Timeline: Begin immediately
  - Blocker: NONE

S60 PHASE 2 (Read Path Migration):
  - Enable AI_JOBS_NEW_SCHEMA=on (feature flag)
  - Change SCAN pattern to ai:job:{workspace_id}:*
  - Remove app-layer filtering loop
  - Monitor for issues

S60 PHASE 3 (Cutover):
  - Disable old schema writes
  - Delete ai:job:{job_id} keys
  - Confirm success in prod, remove feature flag

MIGRATION RISK: LOW
  Reason: Hotfix is correctly positioned as temporary bridge
  Code Evidence: Lines 1512-1514 (webapi.py)

================================================================================
SECURITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

CRITICAL: Workspace ID Format Validation
  Status: FIXED ✓
  Change: .match() → .fullmatch() (line 116, prom.py)
  Reason: Prevents trailing character injection
  Test: Injection test cases added

HIGH: Cursor Injection Protection
  Status: FIXED ✓
  Change: Exception chaining for malformed cursor (lines 1520-1522, webapi.py)
  Evidence: Raises 400 Bad Request with "from e" context
  Risk: NONE - blocking before cursor use

MEDIUM: Permissions Layer Scope
  Status: BY DESIGN (acceptable for v0.1)
  Reason: RBAC is Sprint 58 scope, not v0.1
  Extension: Forward-compatible for S60+
  Risk: NONE - documented as future work

OVERALL: Strong security posture

================================================================================
TEST RESULTS
================================================================================

Total Tests: 60 (ALL PASSING)
  - test_jobs_endpoint.py: 22 tests ✓
  - test_workspace_metrics.py: 38 tests ✓

Coverage Areas:
  ✓ Workspace security validation (6 tests)
  ✓ Canonical workspace ID validation (3 tests)
  ✓ Telemetry helpers (3 tests)
  ✓ Job list endpoint logic (10 tests)
  ✓ Cursor pagination with FakeRedis (stateless)
  ✓ Cross-workspace access prevention (verified)
  ✓ Workspace metrics isolation (38 tests)

Isolation Quality: EXCELLENT
  - FakeRedis prevents external service dependency
  - Fixture cleanup prevents cross-test pollution
  - Metrics registry is isolated per test

================================================================================
CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Architecture: EXCELLENT
  - No circular dependencies
  - No tight coupling
  - Clear layer separation
  - Swappable interfaces (Queue, Store)

Documentation: EXCELLENT
  - Code comments mark temporary patterns
  - Migration references included
  - Implementation guidance provided
  - Architecture review docs comprehensive

Security: STRONG
  - Input validation (fullmatch for format)
  - Exception chaining (prevent info leak)
  - PII redaction (conservative)
  - Safe-by-default telemetry (flag-gated)

Testability: EXCELLENT
  - Unit tests for all layers
  - Integration tests without external deps
  - Isolation prevents flakiness
  - Cursor pagination validated stateless

Performance: GOOD
  - Cursor pagination reduces memory footprint
  - SCAN buffer (limit * 2) acceptable for v0.1
  - S60 optimization (direct pattern) removes buffer
  - Telemetry cardinality bounded

================================================================================
MERGE DECISION

CONDITIONS (Non-Blocking):
  1. Dual-write migration MUST begin in S60 Phase 1 (no delays)

  4. All new code must use SimpleQueue interface (not direct Redis keys)

  ✓ No lint errors (ruff, black)
  ✓ Security fixes applied (fullmatch, exception chaining)
  ✓ Documentation complete
  ✓ Sprint 60 migration path clear

This baseline is production-ready and does not block Sprint 60 dual-write
migration. All conditions are met for immediate merge to main.

Key Message: S59-05 hotfix is correctly positioned as temporary. No architectural
patterns or anti-patterns have been introduced. Code is well-tested, well-documented,
and follows established module boundaries.
