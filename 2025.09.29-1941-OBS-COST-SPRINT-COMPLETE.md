# Observability & Cost Control Sprint Complete

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-29T19:41:00
**Sprint:** Observability & Cost Control
**Status:** ✅ ALL 5 SPRINT COMPONENTS COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive observability and cost control features for the DJP (Debate-Judge-Publish) pipeline. The system now provides real-time dashboards, automated budget controls, intelligent cost optimization, robust retry mechanisms, and complete operational polish.

## Sprint Components Completed

### 1. ✅ Metrics Extraction & Streamlit Dashboards

**Files Created:**
- `src/metrics.py` - Comprehensive metrics extraction and KPI calculation
- `dashboards/observability_app.py` - Interactive Streamlit dashboard

**What It Does:**
- **Data Pipeline**: Extracts and flattens all run artifacts into structured DataFrame
- **KPI Calculation**: Advisory rates, average costs, token usage, provider distribution
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with filtering and drill-down capabilities
- **Artifact Inspector**: Detailed view of individual runs with JSON display

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- Run counts (total, published, advisory, failed)
- Cost metrics (average, trends, by provider)
- Performance metrics (tokens, duration, citations compliance)
- Quality metrics (advisory reasons, safety flags, provider mix)

**Dashboard Features:**
- Time-based filtering (24h, 7d, 30d, 90d, all time)
- Preset and provider filtering
- Interactive charts (cost trends, provider distribution, status breakdown)
- Recent runs table with sortable columns
- Artifact inspection with full JSON view

### 2. ✅ Budgets & Alerts with CLI Gates

**Files Created:**
- `src/costs.py` - Cost projection and budget validation
- `scripts/alerts.py` - Automated alerting system

**Files Modified:**
- `src/run_workflow.py` - Added budget parameters and cost projection

**What It Does:**
- **Pre-execution Budget Checks**: Projects costs and validates against limits
- **Soft/Hard Limits**: Warnings at 90%, blocks at 100% of budget
- **Multi-dimensional Budgets**: Supports both USD and token limits
- **Automated Alerts**: Monitors KPIs and sends webhook notifications
- **Slack Integration**: Webhook payloads compatible with Slack format

**Budget Controls:**
```bash
# USD budget limit
--budget_usd 0.01

# Token budget limit
--budget_tokens 5000

# Combined limits
--budget_usd 0.01 --budget_tokens 5000
```

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Advisory rate > 30% (configurable)
- Average cost > $0.01 per run (configurable)
- Failure rate > 20% (configurable)

### 3. ✅ Cost Levers with Automatic Optimization

**Files Modified:**
- `src/costs.py` - Enhanced with pricing table and projection logic
- `src/debate.py` - Added adaptive debater selection
- `src/run_workflow.py` - Added max_cost_usd parameter

**What It Does:**
- **Pricing Table**: Comprehensive per-1M-token pricing for all providers
- **Cost Projection**: Pre-execution cost estimates with breakdown by stage
- **Adaptive Selection**: Automatically reduces non-OpenAI debaters based on budget
- **Mid-run Limits**: max_cost_usd parameter enables mid-execution cost control

**Cost Optimization Logic:**
- Budget < $0.02: OpenAI models only
- Budget < $0.05: Limited to 1 non-OpenAI model
- Fastpath mode: Prioritizes cost-effective models
- Early termination: Stops if projection exceeds mid-run limit

**Acceptance Test Results:**
```
Projected Cost Breakdown:
  Debate Stage:  $0.0290
  Judge Stage:   $0.0165
  Total Cost:    $0.0480
  Total Tokens:  5,600
```

### 4. ✅ Reliability & Backoff for API Calls

**Files Created:**
- `src/retries.py` - Comprehensive retry framework with exponential backoff

**Files Modified:**
- `src/debate.py` - Integrated retry logic into agent calls

**What It Does:**
- **Exponential Backoff**: Configurable base delay, max delay, and jitter
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Identifies retryable vs non-retryable errors
- **Multiple Decorators**: api_retry, heavy_api_retry, light_api_retry
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Clear failure reasons in artifacts
- **Async/Sync Support**: Works with both synchronous and asynchronous functions

**Retry Features:**
- Exponential backoff with jitter (prevents thundering herd)
- Configurable max attempts and total time limits
- Automatic error classification (network, timeout, rate limit)
- Detailed logging and error messages
- Graceful degradation with fallback responses

**Test Results:**
```
1. Testing async retry with 2 failures:
Result: Success after 3 attempts

2. Testing sync retry with 1 failure:
Result: Success after 2 attempts

3. Testing exhausted retries:
Retry exhausted as expected: API call failed after 3 attempts
```

### 5. ✅ Ops Polish with Metrics Export

**Files Modified:**
- `src/metrics.py` - Added export_metrics() function
- `src/run_workflow.py` - Added --metrics parameter and export logic
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md` - Enhanced with observability section

**What It Does:**
- **CSV Export**: Complete metrics export for external analysis
- **CLI Integration**: --metrics flag exports after each run
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Updated operations guide
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for production observability

**Metrics Export Features:**
- Full run metadata (timestamp, preset, task, trace_name)
- Performance metrics (tokens, cost, duration)
- Quality metrics (status, provider, citations compliance)
- Failure analysis (advisory reasons, safety flags)
- Schema versioning for compatibility

## Technical Highlights
