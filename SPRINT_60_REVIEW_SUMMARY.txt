  SPRINT 60 PHASE 1 CODE REVIEW - SUMMARY TABLE
================================================================================

FINAL VERDICT: FAIL - Cannot merge (3 blocking issues)

================================================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES (Data Loss Risk)
================================================================================

CRITICAL-1: Idempotency Blocks Retries After Partial Failure
  Severity:     CRITICAL (Data Loss)
  Location:     src/queue/simple_queue.py:71-77, 115-139
  Method:       enqueue()
  Issue:        SETNX happens before dual-write; if write fails, idempotency key
                prevents retries; caller cannot retry with same client_request_id
  Risk:         Job lost (not in Redis, blocked by idempotency)
  Fix:          Move SETNX after all writes succeed OR use Redis pipeline
  Effort:       1-2 hours
  Test:         Validated with /tmp/test_critical_issues.py::test_issue_1_*

================================================================================
HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES (Correctness Bugs)
================================================================================

HIGH-1: Non-Atomic Writes Cause Inconsistency
  Severity:     HIGH (Consistency Bug)
  Location:     src/queue/simple_queue.py:96-111
  Method:       enqueue()
  Issue:        3 separate Redis ops (hset old, hset new, rpush)
                Not in pipeline; any can fail independently
                Worker can see job_id in queue but job data missing
  Risk:         Unprocessed jobs, infinite retry loops
  Fix:          Wrap all 3 ops in redis.pipeline()
  Effort:       1-2 hours
  Test:         Validated with /tmp/test_critical_issues.py::test_issue_2_*

---

HIGH-2: Update_Status Silent Divergence
  Severity:     HIGH (Silent Divergence)
  Location:     src/queue/simple_queue.py:208-214
  Method:       update_status()
  Issue:        No error handling; if new schema write fails,
                old schema left with stale update
  Risk:         Job status non-deterministic (depends on read path)
  Fix:          Add try/catch + logging + telemetry for new schema write
  Effort:       1 hour
  Test:         Validated with /tmp/test_critical_issues.py::test_issue_5_*

---

HIGH-3: Queue Consistency Lost if RPush Fails
  Severity:     HIGH (Job Loss)
  Location:     src/queue/simple_queue.py:110-111, 131-135
  Method:       enqueue()
  Issue:        If rpush() fails after dual-write succeeds,
                job exists in Redis but not in queue; cleanup might fail
  Risk:         Orphan keys, unprocessed jobs
  Fix:          Use pipeline (see HIGH-1); add alerts for cleanup failure
  Effort:       Covered by HIGH-1 fix + 30 min for alerts

================================================================================
MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES (Code Quality/Coverage)
================================================================================

MEDIUM-1: Telemetry Import Inside Method
  Severity:     MEDIUM (Performance/Style)
  Location:     src/queue/simple_queue.py:106, 126
  Issue:        Import inside enqueue() method; called on every job
  Fix:          Move to module-level imports at top
  Effort:       15 minutes

---

MEDIUM-2: Fallback Logic No Observability
  Severity:     MEDIUM (Observability)
  Location:     src/queue/simple_queue.py:156-162
  Issue:        get_job() silently falls back from new to old schema
                No logging/telemetry to track migration progress
  Fix:          Add logging and telemetry counter for fallback rate
  Effort:       30 minutes

---

MEDIUM-3: Workspace_ID Not Validated
  Severity:     MEDIUM (Edge Case)
  Location:     src/queue/simple_queue.py:141-145, 209-214
  Issue:        Empty/None workspace_id not validated
                Creates malformed keys like ai:job::{job_id}
  Fix:          Add validation; raise ValueError if invalid
  Effort:       45 minutes

---

MEDIUM-4: Test Coverage Gaps
  Severity:     MEDIUM (Test Coverage)
  Location:     tests/test_dual_write.py (entire file)
  Issue:        Missing 10+ test cases for failure scenarios:
                - Idempotency + retry
                - Partial write + cleanup
                - Error on old key write
                - Error on new key write
                - Error on rpush
                - update_status partial failure
                - workspace_id validation
  Fix:          Add comprehensive error scenario tests
  Effort:       2-3 hours

---

MEDIUM-5: List_Jobs Doesn't Scan New Schema
  Severity:     MEDIUM (Incomplete Feature)
  Location:     src/queue/simple_queue.py:225-271
  Issue:        Only scans old schema keys; misses new schema jobs
  Fix:          Document as Phase 1 limitation, add Phase 2 todo
  Effort:       15 minutes

================================================================================
LOW SEVERITY ISSUES (Nice to Have)
================================================================================

LOW-1: Telemetry Only For Enqueue
  Severity:     LOW (Telemetry Gap)
  Location:     src/telemetry/prom.py:709-722
  Issue:        record_dual_write_attempt() not called for update_status/get_job
  Fix:          Phase 2 enhancement; add comment in Phase 1
  Effort:       5 minutes

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION PRIORITY MATRIX
================================================================================

MUST DO (Blocks Merge):
  1. CRITICAL-1: Fix idempotency scope            [1-2 hrs]
  2. HIGH-1:     Implement atomic pipeline        [1-2 hrs]
  3. HIGH-2:     Add error handling to update_*   [1 hr]
  ---
  TOTAL: 3-5 hours

SHOULD DO (Before Canary):
  4. HIGH-3:     Add cleanup alerts              [30 min]
  5. MEDIUM-1:   Move telemetry import           [15 min]
  6. MEDIUM-3:   Add workspace_id validation     [45 min]
  7. MEDIUM-4:   Add 10 missing test cases       [2-3 hrs]
  ---
  TOTAL: 4-5 hours

NICE TO HAVE (Phase 2):
  8. MEDIUM-2:   Add fallback observability      [30 min]
  9. MEDIUM-5:   Document list_jobs limitation   [15 min]
  10. LOW-1:     Extend telemetry coverage       [5 min]
  ---
  TOTAL: 50 minutes

================================================================================
RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Data Loss Risk:         HIGH (Issues CRITICAL-1, HIGH-3)
Consistency Risk:       HIGH (Issues HIGH-1, HIGH-2)
Production Blast Radius: MEDIUM (affects all new jobs with dual-write flag)
Observability Risk:     MEDIUM (silent divergence, missing telemetry)
Recovery Difficulty:    HIGH (must distinguish old vs new schema state)

RECOMMENDATION: Do not deploy until CRITICAL-1, HIGH-1, HIGH-2 are fixed.
                Proceed with full testing after fixes.

================================================================================
VALIDATION EVIDENCE
================================================================================

All critical issues validated with test reproductions:
  - File: /tmp/test_critical_issues.py
  - Tests: 3 reproduction scripts confirming each issue
  - Output: Exact failure modes demonstrated

All existing tests pass (5/5) but don't cover failure scenarios.

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Engineer reads this review (SPRINT_60_PHASE_1_CODE_REVIEW.md)
2. Fix all CRITICAL and HIGH issues (5-7 hours)
3. Add MEDIUM-4 test cases (2-3 hours)
4. Re-run full test suite (ensure 30+ tests still pass)
5. Resubmit PR with test results
6. Re-review (2-3 hours expected)
7. After approval: Merge, stage, canary, production

ESTIMATED TOTAL REMEDIATION TIME: 10-15 hours (engineering + testing)
