# Relay Platform Audit Report - Post-Sprint 51

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Automated)
**Scope:** Full platform audit after Sprint 51 completion
**Branch:** `audit/51-snapshot`

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** 🟡 **YELLOW** - Strong foundation, critical blockers prevent production readiness

Sprint 51 delivered comprehensive platform hardening across 3 phases (Auth/RBAC, Rate Limiting/Security, CI/CD/Observability). However, **Phases 2 and 3 are not yet merged to main**, blocking automated operations and monitoring.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Strong:** Authentication, RBAC, audit logging, security headers, rate limiting (implemented but not deployed)
- 🟡 **Moderate:** CI/CD pipeline, backups, SLO monitoring (defined but not active)
- 🔴 **Critical:** No automated deployments, no database backups, no production alerting

**Recommendation:** **Merge Phases 2/3 immediately** before starting Sprint 52. Current state leaves platform vulnerable to data loss and outages.

## Health Heatmap

| Area | Status | Score | Justification |
|------|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Security** | 🟢 GREEN | 85% | Auth/RBAC complete, rate limiting ready, security headers defined, webhook signing active. Missing: automated secrets scanning in CI. |
| **Reliability** | 🔴 RED | 40% | CI/CD defined but not active. No automated backups. Restore drill never run. Rollback automation incomplete. Single point of failure. |
| **Observability** | 🟡 YELLOW | 60% | Metrics collecting (Prometheus). SLOs defined. Alert rules/dashboards ready but not deployed. No error budget tracking. |
| **Docs** | 🟢 GREEN | 90% | Comprehensive docs for webhook signing, SLOs, deployment. Sprint status docs complete. Evidence templates ready. Missing: runbooks for common incidents. |
| **Product** | 🟡 YELLOW | 70% | Actions API complete (list/preview/execute). Studio UI functional. Missing: Chat MVP, OAuth, workspace switcher. |

## Top 10 Risks (Ranked)

### 1. 🔴 P0: No Automated Database Backups
**Risk:** Data loss from corruption/deletion with no recovery method
**Impact:** CRITICAL - potential business extinction event
**Mitigation:** Merge Phase 3, verify nightly cron runs
**Ticket:** P0-001, P1-002

### 2. 🔴 P0: No Automated Deployments
**Risk:** Manual deploys = human error, no smoke test gate
**Impact:** HIGH - production outages, no rollback capability
**Mitigation:** Merge Phase 3, configure GitHub secrets
**Ticket:** P0-001

### 3. 🔴 P0: No Production Alerting
**Risk:** Outages/latency undetected until users complain
**Impact:** HIGH - reputation damage, SLA breaches
**Mitigation:** Merge Phase 3, import alert rules
**Ticket:** P0-001

### 4. 🟡 P1: Restore Drill Never Run
**Risk:** Backups may be corrupted/incomplete/unrestorable
**Impact:** HIGH - false sense of security, unrecoverable data loss
**Mitigation:** Run manual restore drill immediately
**Ticket:** P1-002

### 5. 🟡 P1: Rollback Automation Incomplete
**Risk:** Failed deployments require manual intervention
**Impact:** MEDIUM - extended outages, no automated recovery
**Mitigation:** Complete Railway API integration in rollback script
**Ticket:** [Create P1-003]

### 6. 🟡 P1: OAuth Not Integrated
**Risk:** Users can't authenticate for Chat MVP (Sprint 52)
**Impact:** MEDIUM - delays Sprint 52, poor user experience
**Mitigation:** Prioritize OAuth in Sprint 52 Week 2
**Ticket:** [Sprint 52 backlog]

### 7. 🟡 P2: OTel Tracing Not Deployed
**Risk:** Limited debugging capability for distributed calls
**Impact:** LOW - manual log inspection required
**Mitigation:** Deploy existing OTel code, configure collector
**Ticket:** [Create P2-001]

### 8. 🟡 P2: No Load Testing
**Risk:** Unknown performance under load, potential bottlenecks
**Impact:** MEDIUM - poor user experience at scale
**Mitigation:** Add load testing in Sprint 52 Week 3
**Ticket:** [Sprint 52 backlog]

### 9. 🟡 P2: Single Instance Deployment
**Risk:** No horizontal scaling, single point of failure
**Impact:** MEDIUM - availability limited by single instance
**Mitigation:** Plan multi-instance deployment for Sprint 53
**Ticket:** [Sprint 53 backlog]

### 10. 🟡 P3: Error Budget Not Tracked
**Risk:** SLO breaches unnoticed, no proactive response
**Impact:** LOW - reactive vs proactive reliability
**Mitigation:** Automate weekly SLO compliance reports
**Ticket:** [Create P3-001]
