|--------|-------|------------|
| `ok` | ___ | ___% |
| `error` | ___ | ___% |
| `timeout` | ___ | ___% |
| **Total** | ___ | 100% |

**Dashboard Screenshot:** [Insert screenshot of "Controller Run Status" panel]

### 1.2 Decision Patterns

**Query:**
```promql
sum(increase(rollout_controller_changes_total[24h])) by (result)
```

**Results:**
| Decision | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| `promote` | ___ | ___% |
| `hold` | ___ | ___% |
| `rollback` | ___ | ___% |
| **Total** | ___ | 100% |

**Dashboard Screenshot:** [Insert screenshot of "Controller Decision History" panel]

**Analysis:**
- [ ] Decision logic behaving as expected
- [ ] No unexpected rollbacks (would indicate SLO violations)
- [ ] Hold decisions correlate with known metric spikes

**Decision Timeline:**
```
[TIMESTAMP] - promote (SLOs met, traffic >threshold)
[TIMESTAMP] - hold (error rate 1.2%, above threshold)
[TIMESTAMP] - promote (SLOs recovered)
...
```

### 1.3 Rollout Percentage Trace

**Query:**
```promql
rollout_controller_percent{feature="google"}
```

**Dashboard Screenshot:** [Insert screenshot of "Rollout Percentage History" panel]

**Expected Behavior in Dry-Run:**
- Percentage stays at 0% (dry-run mode doesn't write to flags)
- Metric still tracks _what percentage would be set_ if dry-run disabled

**Observed Percentage Range:** [MIN] - [MAX]%

**Analysis:**
- [ ] Would controller have promoted steadily from 0% → 10% → 25%?
- [ ] Or would it have held at lower percentages due to SLO violations?

   ```

2. **Set initial rollout percentage**
   ```bash
   python scripts/rollout_controller.py --set-percent google [RECOMMENDED_VALUE]
   ```

3. **Monitor Phase 5 progression**
