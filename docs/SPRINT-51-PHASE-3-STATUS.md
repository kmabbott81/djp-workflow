### 3. Observability (SLOs/Alerts/Dashboards) ✅

**Commit:** `0ff8df9`

**Implementation:**
- **`docs/observability/SLOs.md`** (297 lines)
  - **SLO Definitions:**
    - Light endpoints (list/preview): p99 ≤ 50ms
    - Webhook execute: p95 ≤ 1.2s
    - Error rate: ≤ 1% (7-day window)
    - Availability: ≥ 99.9% uptime (30-day window)
  - **Error Budget Calculations:**
    - Formula: `(Total - Good) / Total`
    - Consumption thresholds: <50% (green), 50-80% (yellow), 80-100% (red)
    - Example: 1M requests/month, 1% budget = 10K allowed failures
  - **Alert Thresholds:**
    - Latency: p99 > 50ms for 5m (warning)
    - Errors: rate > 1% for 5m (critical)
    - Sustained errors: rate > 10% for 3m (page)
  - **PromQL Queries:**
    - Latency: `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`
    - Error rate: `sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))`
    - Availability: `avg_over_time(up{job="relay-backend"}[30d])`

- **`observability/dashboards/alerts.json`** (152 lines)
  - **8 Alert Rules:**
    1. `LightEndpointLatencyHigh` - p99 > 50ms for 5m
    2. `WebhookExecuteLatencyHigh` - p95 > 1.2s for 5m
    3. `ActionsErrorRateHigh` - 5xx rate > 1% for 5m
    4. `HighErrorStreak` - 5xx rate > 10% for 3m (page)
    5. `RateLimitBreaches` - sustained hits > 10m
    6. `ServiceDown` - health check fails for 1m (page)
    7. `DatabaseConnectionPoolExhausted` - pool > 90% for 5m
    8. `RedisDown` - Redis unavailable for 5m
  - **Metadata:**
    - Severity levels: info, warning, critical, page
    - Runbook URLs to SLO docs
    - Annotations with actionable descriptions

- **`observability/dashboards/golden-signals.json`** (388 lines)
  - **Grafana Dashboard** (8 panels):
    1. **Request Rate (RPM)** - Line graph by endpoint
    2. **Error Rate (%)** - 5xx errors vs total
    3. **Latency (p50/p95/p99) - Light Endpoints** - Multi-line graph
    4. **Latency (p50/p95) - Webhook Execute** - Multi-line graph
    5. **Rate Limit Hits (429s)** - Counter (24h)
    6. **SLO Error Budget Remaining** - Gauge (green/yellow/red)
    7. **Service Availability (Uptime %)** - Stat (30-day)
    8. **Total Requests (24h)** - Stat with area graph
  - **Features:**
    - Alert annotations (shows firing alerts on graphs)
    - Thresholds: 50ms (light), 1.2s (webhook)
    - Auto-refresh: 30s
    - Time range: Last 24h (adjustable to 7/30 days)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ SLOs documented with quantitative targets
- ✅ Alert rules trigger on threshold breaches

## Breaking Changes

**None.** All changes are additive:
- CI/CD workflows trigger only on specific branches
- Backup cron runs independently
- SLOs and dashboards are documentation/config (no code changes)

## Deployment Notes

**Status:** Ready for merge to `main`

**Prerequisites:**
- GitHub Secrets configured: `RAILWAY_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`, `ADMIN_KEY`, `DEV_KEY`
- Railway project linked
- Prometheus/Grafana available for metrics collection

**Post-Merge Actions:**
1. Import alert rules into Prometheus: `observability/dashboards/alerts.json`
2. Import Grafana dashboard: `observability/dashboards/golden-signals.json`
3. Verify nightly backup cron runs (check GitHub Actions next day)
4. Run manual restore drill: `gh workflow run backup.yml`
5. Execute production smoke tests using `docs/evidence/sprint-51/phase3/SMOKE-TESTS.md`

## Rollback Plan

**Code Rollback:**
```bash
git revert HEAD~4..HEAD
git push origin sprint/51-phase3-ops --force
```

**Disable CI/CD Pipeline:**
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/deploy.yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - DISABLED  # Change to disabled branch
```

**Disable Backup Cron:**

# In .github/workflows/backup.yml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual only, remove schedule
```

**Confirm Health:**
```bash
curl -s https://relay-production-f2a6.up.railway.app/_stcore/health
# Expected: {"ok":true}
```

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why GitHub Actions for Backups?

**Rationale:** GitHub Actions provides free cron scheduling, artifact storage (30-day retention), and integration with Railway secrets. Alternative (S3) would require additional infrastructure and cost.

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Free for public repos, included in paid plans
- ✅ Automatic retention management
- ⚠️ 30-day artifact limit (acceptable for nightly backups)
- ✅ Restore drills validate backups regularly

### Why PromQL Alert Rules in JSON?

**Rationale:** JSON format is portable across Prometheus (alerting rules file) and Grafana (alert groups). PromQL expressions can be imported directly without translation.

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Portable across monitoring tools
- ✅ Version controlled (git)
- ✅ Declarative (no manual UI setup)
- ⚠️ Requires manual import (not automated)

### Why Template Smoke Tests?

**Rationale:** Production smoke tests require live secrets and production environment. Providing a template allows manual execution after deployment with proper secrets.

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ No secrets committed to git
- ✅ Copy-paste ready for production validation
- ⚠️ Manual execution required (not automated in PR)
- ✅ CI smoke tests run automatically via deploy workflow

---

## Conclusion

Sprint 51 Phase 3 successfully delivered all 4 deferred operational excellence items:

✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated releases with migrations and smoke tests
✅ **Database Backups** - Nightly backups + monthly restore validation
✅ **Observability** - SLOs, alerts, and golden signals dashboard
✅ **Evidence Package** - Production smoke test templates

The platform now has an **industrial-strength release and monitoring foundation**, ready to support Chat MVP, OAuth, and horizontal scaling in Sprint 52.

**Next Action:** Merge `sprint/51-phase3-ops` → `main` and import observability configs into Prometheus/Grafana.
