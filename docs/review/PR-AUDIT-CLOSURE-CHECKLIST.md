# PR Audit Closure Checklist

**Sprint 52 ‚Äì Agent Orchestration (Phase 2)**
**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Purpose:** Self-service checklist for reviewing and closing audit-driven PRs

---

## Overview

This checklist provides a systematic process for reviewing PRs that emerge from platform audits. Use this for any PR tagged with **üîê Audit Closure** or **üìã Platform Alignment** to ensure operational readiness before merging to `main`.

---

## Pre-Review: Audit Context

### Audit Reference

- [ ] **Audit date identified** (e.g., 2025-10-07)
- [ ] **Audit report located** (e.g., `docs/audit/YYYY-MM-DD/AUDIT-REPORT.md`)
- [ ] **Priority risks documented** (P0/P1/P2/P3 classification)
- [ ] **PR linked to specific audit findings** (reference risk IDs in PR description)

### PR Metadata

- [ ] **PR title follows convention:** `Sprint XX ‚Äì [Theme]` or `üîê Audit Closure ‚Äì [Focus Area]`
- [ ] **Base branch verified:** Should target `main` unless explicitly multi-stage
- [ ] **Labels applied:**
  - `audit-closure` for P0/P1 resolution
  - `platform` for infrastructure/operational changes
  - `security` for security hardening
  - `observability` for monitoring/alerting
- [ ] **Reviewers assigned:** Minimum 1 platform/SRE reviewer for production changes

---

## Part 1: Risk Resolution Verification

### Critical Risks (P0)

For each P0 risk listed in the audit:

- [ ] **Risk ID documented** in PR description (e.g., "Resolves P0-001")
- [ ] **Root cause understood** (why did this gap exist?)
- [ ] **Resolution approach explained** (what changes were made?)
- [ ] **Evidence provided:**
  - [ ] Code changes (file paths + line numbers)
  - [ ] Test results (unit tests, integration tests, smoke tests)
  - [ ] Deployment artifacts (CI/CD logs, migration scripts)
  - [ ] Validation output (e.g., restore drill results, alert verification)
- [ ] **Rollback plan documented** (what if this fails in production?)

**Example:**
```markdown
## P0-001: Phase 2 & 3 PRs Not Merged

**Root Cause:** Sprint 51 work remained in feature branches, blocking production deployment.

**Resolution:** Merged both branches into `sprint/52-platform-alignment` with conflict resolution.

**Evidence:**
- 128 files changed, 19,300+ lines added
- 31 unit tests passing (test_rate_limiter.py, test_auth.py, test_audit_logger.py)
- CI/CD pipeline validated with smoke tests

**Rollback:** Revert merge commit `abc123` if production deployment fails health checks.
```

### High Risks (P1)

For each P1 risk:

- [ ] **Risk ID documented** in PR description
- [ ] **Resolution approach explained**
- [ ] **Evidence provided** (code + tests + validation)
- [ ] **Monitoring added** to prevent recurrence (alerts, dashboards, runbooks)

---

## Part 2: Code Review (Functional)

### Architecture & Design

- [ ] **Changes align with first principles:**
  - [ ] Provider-agnostic (no hard-coded dependencies on single vendors)
  - [ ] Safety by design (preview‚Üíconfirm, audit trails, scoped permissions)
  - [ ] Performance as product (P95 < 500ms reads, P99 < 1s orchestrations)
- [ ] **New dependencies justified:**
  - [ ] Package added to `pyproject.toml` or `package.json` with version pinning
  - [ ] License checked (permissive: MIT/Apache/BSD preferred)
  - [ ] Security vulnerabilities checked (`npm audit`, `safety check`)
- [ ] **Database migrations included** (if schema changes exist)
  - [ ] Migration script follows naming convention (`YYYY-MM-DD_description.sql`)
  - [ ] Rollback migration provided
  - [ ] Tested against production-like dataset

### Code Quality

- [ ] **Linters pass:** `black`, `ruff` (Python); `eslint`, `prettier` (JS)
- [ ] **Type checking passes:** `mypy` (Python); `tsc` (TypeScript)
- [ ] **Tests added for new functionality:**
  - [ ] Unit tests (‚â•80% coverage for new code)
  - [ ] Integration tests (for external dependencies: Redis, Postgres, APIs)
  - [ ] Smoke tests (for critical paths: auth, actions, health)
- [ ] **Secrets not hardcoded:**
  - [ ] Environment variables used for credentials
  - [ ] `.gitignore` updated to exclude sensitive files
  - [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent credential commits (`detect-private-key`)

### Security Hardening

- [ ] **Authentication & authorization:**
  - [ ] API keys hashed with Argon2 (no plaintext storage)
  - [ ] RBAC enforced (admin/developer/viewer roles)
  - [ ] Rate limiting active (Redis + in-process fallback)
- [ ] **Security headers configured:**
  - [ ] HSTS (`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`)
  - [ ] CSP (`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`)
  - [ ] Referrer Policy (`Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`)
  - [ ] MIME Type Sniffing (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`)
- [ ] **Input validation:**
  - [ ] Pydantic models validate all request bodies
  - [ ] SQL parameterization (no string interpolation)
  - [ ] File upload size limits enforced
- [ ] **Audit logging:**
  - [ ] Sensitive parameters redacted (passwords, tokens)
  - [ ] User actions logged (who, what, when, where)
  - [ ] Log retention policy defined (e.g., 90 days)

## Part 3: Operational Readiness

### CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] **Deployment workflow exists:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- [ ] **Pre-deployment checks:**
  - [ ] Linters run automatically (`black`, `ruff`, `eslint`)
  - [ ] Unit tests run on every commit

  - [ ] Smoke tests run after deployment
- [ ] **Rollback automation:**
  - [ ] Previous deployment tagged (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
  - [ ] Rollback script tested (`scripts/rollback_release.py`)
  - [ ] Alert on deployment failure (Slack, PagerDuty)

### Database Backups

- [ ] **Backup automation exists:** `.github/workflows/backup.yml`
- [ ] **Backup schedule configured:**
  - [ ] Daily backups at off-peak hours (e.g., 02:00 UTC)
  - [ ] Retention: 30 days (daily) + 12 months (monthly)
- [ ] **Restore drill scheduled:**
  - [ ] Monthly restore validation (`scripts/db_restore_check.py`)
  - [ ] Evidence artifacts retained (90 days)
  - [ ] Alert on restore failure

### Observability

- [ ] **Service Level Objectives (SLOs) defined:**

  - [ ] Error rate SLOs (e.g., ‚â§ 1% for 7-day window)
  - [ ] Availability SLOs (e.g., ‚â• 99.9% uptime)
- [ ] **Prometheus alerts configured:**
  - [ ] Alert rules exist (`observability/dashboards/alerts.json`)
  - [ ] Severity levels appropriate (`info`, `warning`, `critical`, `page`)

  - [ ] Watch latency (p95 ‚â§ 1.2s for webhook execute)
  - [ ] Watch alerts (no critical/page alerts firing)
  - [ ] Review logs for unexpected errors

### Rollback Plan

If deployment fails or causes production issues:

- [ ] **Rollback trigger criteria defined:**
  - [ ] Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
  - [ ] Latency p95 > 2x baseline for 10 minutes
  - [ ] Critical alert firing (ServiceDown, DatabaseConnectionPoolExhausted)
- [ ] **Rollback execution:**
  ```bash
  # Automated rollback

  # Manual rollback (if script fails)
  git revert <merge-commit-sha>
  git push origin main
  ```
- [ ] **Post-rollback actions:**
  - [ ] Incident report created (`docs/incidents/YYYY-MM-DD-[title].md`)
  - [ ] Root cause analysis scheduled (within 48 hours)
  - [ ] Fix deployed in hotfix branch
