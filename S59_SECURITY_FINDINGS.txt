SECURITY REVIEW: Sprint 59 S59-01 Commit A - Metrics Workspace Label Plumbing
Commit: 9daeadb | Branch: sprint-59/s59-01-metrics-workspace | Date: 2025-10-16

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================
Status: CONDITIONAL PASS - 1 CRITICAL bug must be fixed before merge
Risk Level: HIGH (due to CRITICAL regex vulnerability)
Recommendation: Do NOT merge without fix

FINDINGS
========

[CRITICAL] HIGH: Regex Validation Vulnerability - Label Injection / Cardinality Explosion
File: src/telemetry/prom.py, line 106
Issue: Uses re.match() instead of re.fullmatch() - allows trailing character injection
Impact: Attacker can inject newlines/special chars to bypass validation: "workspace\n" passes
Attack: Unbounded cardinality via "workspace\nmalicious" + Prometheus label injection
Fix: Change line 106 from:
     if not _WORKSPACE_ID_PATTERN.match(workspace_id):
     to:
     if not _WORKSPACE_ID_PATTERN.fullmatch(workspace_id):
Evidence: Python test shows pattern.match("workspace\n") returns Match but fullmatch returns None

[HIGH] Missing Security Test Coverage - Injection Variants
File: tests/test_workspace_metrics.py
Issue: Tests do not cover newline, null byte, or control character injection
Missing: test_invalid_newline_injection, test_invalid_null_byte_injection, test_invalid_prometheus_special_chars
Impact: Regression risk if buggy regex reintroduced in future commits
Fix: Add 4 test cases for:
     - Newline injection: "workspace\n", "workspace\r\n"
     - Null byte: "workspace\x00"
     - Control chars: "workspace\t"
     - Prometheus special chars: "workspace\"", "workspace\\"
Effort: ~30 lines of test code

[MEDIUM] Cardinality Safeguard - Implementation Deferred to Commit B
File: src/telemetry/prom.py, lines 415-430
Issue: workspace_id parameter accepted but NOT validated or used in recording functions
Context: Commit A is parameter plumbing only; Commit B will wire up actual label attachment
Risk: If Commit B doesn't validate before using, cardinality explosion possible
Mitigation: Review Commit B to ensure canonical_workspace_id() called before label attachment
Recommendation: Add validation code pattern to Commit A for reference (see full review)

[MEDIUM] Allowlist Parsing - Configuration Validation
File: src/telemetry/prom.py, line 117
Issue: Silent acceptance of malformed allowlists; no warning if allowlist is empty or invalid
Example: "METRICS_WORKSPACE_ALLOWLIST=ws1,,,ws2" accepted silently
Impact: Operational - misconfiguration could silently block all workspaces
Fix: Add validation logging if allowlist is set but results in empty set or invalid entries
Effort: ~10 lines

POSITIVE FINDINGS
=================

[PASS] Default-Safe Design
- METRICS_WORKSPACE_LABEL=off by default (feature disabled unless explicitly enabled)
- Workspace labels not attached unless both enabled AND valid
- Prevents cardinality explosion in production by default

[PASS] Backward Compatibility
- workspace_id parameter optional with None default
- Existing code continues working without changes
- No breaking changes to function signatures
- Graceful handling of None/invalid workspace_id

[PASS] Allowlist Enforcement
- METRICS_WORKSPACE_ALLOWLIST env var enforced when set
- Comma-separated parsing with whitespace trimming
- Rejects workspace IDs not in allowlist (when configured)

[PASS] Test Coverage (Pre-fix)
- 28 tests passing
- Flag behavior tested (default off, case-insensitive)
- Format validation tested (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, 32 char max)
- Backward compatibility verified
- Signature validation verified

[PASS] Logging
- Invalid format logged: _LOG.warning() with details
- Allowlist mismatches logged: _LOG.warning()
- Suitable for debugging and security audit trails

CARDINALITY RISK ANALYSIS
==========================

Baseline (no workspace labels):
  - Provider × Action × Status ≈ 500 time series
  - + Job types ≈ 10 time series
  - TOTAL: ~510 time series (acceptable)

With Workspace Labels (flag=on, allowlist=100 workspaces):
  - Provider × Action × Status × Workspace = 500 × 100 = 50,000 time series (acceptable)
  - Allowlist enforcement keeps N_workspaces bounded

Current Bug Risk (if Commit B wires up without fix):
  - Newline injection bypasses validation
  - Attacker can provide "ws1\nws2\nws3" etc.
  - Unbounded cardinality → OOMKill or runaway costs
  - RISK LEVEL: CRITICAL

Post-Fix (with fullmatch):
  - Injection vectors eliminated
  - Cardinality bounded via allowlist
  - RISK LEVEL: LOW

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (Priority Order)
====================================

1. FIX CRITICAL: Regex bug (DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)
   File: src/telemetry/prom.py, line 106
   Change: .match() → .fullmatch()
   Time: 5 minutes
   Test: pytest tests/test_workspace_metrics.py -v

2. ADD HIGH: Injection test cases (DO BEFORE MERGE)
   File: tests/test_workspace_metrics.py
   Add: 4 test cases for newline/null/control char/prometheus special chars
   Time: 15 minutes
   Test: pytest tests/test_workspace_metrics.py -v (expect 32 tests passing)

3. IMPROVE MEDIUM: Allowlist validation logging
   File: src/telemetry/prom.py, line 117
   Add: Warning if allowlist is empty or contains invalid entries
   Time: 10 minutes

4. REVIEW: Commit B implementation
   File: Will be in next commit
   Ensure: canonical_workspace_id() called before using workspace_id in labels
   Pattern: Validation before use, fallback to no-label if invalid

5. UPDATE DOCS: Clarify parameter deferral
   Add note to docstring or commit message: "Parameter accepted; label wiring deferred to Commit B"

TESTING CHECKLIST
=================

Before Merge:
[ ] Regex fix applied (.fullmatch replaces .match)
[ ] All 28 existing tests passing
[ ] 4 new injection tests added and passing
[ ] pytest tests/test_workspace_metrics.py -v output shows 32/32 passing
[ ] No new regressions in other telemetry tests
[ ] Linting clean (black, ruff)
[ ] Code review approval

[ ] Commit hash verified
[ ] Tag released

Before Commit B:

CONCLUSION
==========

Recommendation: CONDITIONAL PASS - Fix the regex bug before merge
Security Posture: HIGH RISK (CRITICAL) → LOW RISK (after fix)
Exit Criteria: BLOCKED on CRITICAL regex fix
Production Ready: NOT READY (pending fix + Commit B integration)

The infrastructure is sound (default-safe design, allowlist, backward compatible)
but the regex validation bug is a showstopper. Fix is trivial (1 LOC change).
Do not merge or proceed with Commit B until this is fixed.
