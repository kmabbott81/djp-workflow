## Architecture Decision Summary

### Approval Decision: APPROVED

**Reasoning:**
1. **Design is sound:** Conservative, cardinality-aware, properly gated
2. **Safeguards sufficient:** Format validation + allowlist prevents injection/DoS
3. **Backward compatible:** Optional parameters, no breaking changes
4. **Well-tested:** 28 tests, 100% pass rate
5. **Properly decoupled:** Commit A can merge independently
6. **Clear integration path:** Commit B has well-defined targets

### Severity Assessment

| Level | Count | Details |
|-------|-------|---------|
| CRITICAL | 0 | None identified |
| HIGH | 0 | None identified |
| MEDIUM | 1 | Parameters accepted but not used (intentional design) |
| LOW | 0 | None identified |

### Key Positive Findings

1. Flag-gating approach consistent with existing telemetry patterns
2. Cardinality bounds (O(workspace × provider × status)) well-analyzed
3. Allowlist enforcement prevents DoS
4. Format validation prevents injection
5. Incremental design enables independent Commit A merge
6. Clear integration points for Commit B
7. Extensible for Sprint 60+ features

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Merge Phase)
1. Review EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_S59_01_A.txt
2. Approve merge decision
3. Ensure commit message references Sprint 59-01 Commit A and Commit B plan
4. Merge commit 9daeadb to main

### Short-term (Commit B Implementation)
1. Assign Commit B owner
2. Review S59_01_COMMIT_B_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
3. Create Commit B PR with integration checklist
4. Implement plumbing and wiring
5. Week 1: Complete and test Commit B

### Medium-term (Rollout)
1. Week 2: Canary rollout (small allowlist)
2. Week 3+: Gradual expansion
3. Monitor Prometheus cardinality
4. Update Grafana dashboards
