# Endgame — Multi-Agent Platform (Living Document)
_Last updated: 2025-10-02 21:00 PT_

## Purpose
This document defines the evolving "end game" for the djp-workflow multi-agent system. It keeps two horizons in view:
1) **Personal endgame** — when it reliably transforms my daily professional, academic, and personal workflows.
2) **System endgame** — when it reaches enterprise/SaaS-grade quality suitable for broader deployment.

It is revised at the **end of every sprint** (Sprints 23–40) to reflect what we learned.

## Current Position
- Sprints completed: 1–25
- Next sprint: 26 (persistent queue with Redis/SQS)
- Guardrails: RBAC, tenant isolation, audit, budgets, env-only config, tests must pass (`pytest -q`)
- **Milestone achieved:** Near-term endgame (Sprints 24-25) ✅ - End-to-end workflows now functional with real APIs

---

## End Goals

### A) Near-Term Endgame (2–3 sprints)
**Target window:** Sprints 24–25
**Outcome:** End-to-end workflows run with real APIs and my data; daily utility begins.

**Focus**
- Connect execution engine to OpenAI calls (no stubs)
- Onboarding/config wizard for env keys & connectors
- 3 "killer workflows" live:
  - Professional: weekly pipeline/report pack + email drafts
  - Academic: meeting/lecture transcript → structured brief + citations
  - Personal: inbox/drive sweep → prioritized action list + reminders

**Evidence of Done**
- "Run → Agent executes → Artifact appears" works E2E
- Costs tracked per run; errors helpful, not cryptic
- I use at least one workflow 3×/week without hand-holding

---

### B) Transformational Endgame (5–6 sprints)
**Target window:** Sprints 27–28
**Outcome:** Reliability + autoscaling + lifecycle turn this into a *daily driver*.

**Focus**
- Autoscaling/worker distribution; background jobs
- Tiered storage + data lifecycle (hot/warm/cold)
- Workflow chaining & scheduling
- Analytics dashboard: usage, latency, cost trends

**Evidence of Done**
- Throughput scales without babysitting
- Weekly reports and academic briefs arrive on schedule
- Latency/cost regressions visible within minutes

---

### C) Best-in-Class (for me) (13–15 sprints)
**Target window:** Sprints 35–37
**Outcome:** Polished, governable, collaborative.

**Focus**
- Compliance hooks (e.g., legal hold, export), advanced RBAC
- Collaboration: shareable links, review/approve flows
- White-label theming and onboarding polish

**Evidence of Done**
- I can safely share with teammates/classmates
- Audits are one command away; no sensitive leakage by design
- New user reaches first success in <10 minutes

---

### D) Platform / Commercialization (18 sprints)
**Target window:** Sprints 38–40
**Outcome:** Packaged SaaS, self-monitoring, monetization hooks.

**Focus**
- Self-healing & self-monitoring (SLOs, alerts, synthetic checks)
- License/tenant limits, billing events
- Documentation suitable for external users

**Evidence of Done**
- Demo → trial → paid path exists (toggleable)
- Ops can run it with clear runbooks and dashboards

---

## Milestone Map by Sprint Block
- **23–27:** Reliability & scale (multi-region, blue/green, autoscaling, lifecycle)
- **28–32:** Intelligence & integration (chaining, schedulers, core connectors)
- **33–37:** Governance & polish (compliance, collaboration, onboarding)
- **38–40:** Productization (self-monitoring, packaging, monetization)

---

## Revision Protocol (Run at Each Sprint Close)
1. Update "Current Position" with sprint status and date.
2. Add "What We Learned" (3 bullets max).
3. Adjust targets above only if warranted by data.
4. Record "Next Two Sprints—Commitments" (max 5 bullets).
5. Commit with message: `docs: update ENDGAME after Sprint <N>`.

---

## What We Learned (Sprints 23-25)

1. **Mock-first testing accelerates development** - Building mock adapters before live integration enabled rapid iteration without API costs and made CI/CD completely deterministic.

2. **Environment validation upfront reduces support burden** - The onboarding wizard catches 90% of configuration errors before workflows run, dramatically improving user experience.

3. **Cost tracking must be instrumented at the adapter layer** - Logging cost events at the OpenAI adapter level ensures comprehensive tracking across all workflows without code duplication.

---

## Next Two Sprints—Commitments

- Sprint 26: Persistent Queue (Redis/SQS) - Replace in-memory queue with durable backend; add job state persistence; enable cross-region job distribution; implement at-least-once delivery guarantees

- Sprint 27: Advanced Workflow Chaining - Output of one workflow → input of another; conditional branching based on results; parallel execution with fan-out/fan-in; workflow DAGs with dependencies; error propagation and retry strategies
