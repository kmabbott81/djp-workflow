**Project:** openai-agents-workflows-2025.09.28-v1

## Claude Code Restoration Instructions

To get Claude Code back into this project and resume work:

1. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\kylem\openai-agents-workflows-2025.09.28-v1
   ```

2. **Tell Claude Code:**
   ```
   Please review the contents of this OpenAI Agents workflows project folder. Read through all the log files starting with the most recent, understand the current state, and pick up where we left off building OpenAI Agents workflows. The project uses the OpenAI Agents SDK (version 0.3.2) which is already installed.
   ```

## Current Session State

### What We've Accomplished:
- ✅ Researched OpenAI Agents SDK capabilities and features
- ✅ Successfully installed OpenAI Agents SDK v0.3.2 via pip
- ✅ Verified installation (import via `agents` module)
- ✅ Created project folder: `openai-agents-workflows-2025.09.28-v1`
- ✅ Established logging system with timestamped files

### SDK Installation Details:
- **Package:** openai-agents v0.3.2
- **Location:** C:\Users\kylem\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\site-packages

- **Function Tools**: Convert Python functions to AI tools with automatic schema generation

### Next Steps (Ready to Work On):
- Design first agent workflow
- Implement basic agent with tools
- Set up agent handoffs
- Add guardrails for safety
- Build example workflows (customer support, research, etc.)

### Environment:
- **OS:** Windows 11
- **Working Directory:** C:\Users\kylem
- **Git Repo:** Yes (master branch)
