PROJECT: Dual-Write Migration (Redis Key Schema Evolution)
BRANCH:  feat/rollout-infrastructure
BASE:    main
DATE:    2025-10-17 10:15 UTC

================================================================================
QUICK VERDICT
================================================================================

Status:     FAIL - Cannot merge
Blockers:   3 critical/high issues
Fix Time:   6-9 hours
Tests:      5/5 current pass, 10+ new needed

RECOMMENDATION: Do not deploy. Fix blockers, add tests, re-review.

WHAT WAS REVIEWED
================================================================================

Files Reviewed:
  1. src/queue/simple_queue.py  (230 lines, dual-write logic)
  2. src/telemetry/prom.py     (720 lines, telemetry counter added)
  3. tests/test_dual_write.py   (166 lines, 5 tests)
  4. SPRINT_60_PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT.md (330 lines, implementation summary)

Scope: Atomicity, error handling, idempotency, test coverage, regressions

================================================================================
BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Merge)
================================================================================

BLOCKER 1: Data Loss on Retry (CRITICAL-1)
  Issue:  Idempotency check blocks retries after partial failure
  Impact: Job is lost (not in Redis, idempotency key prevents retry)
  Scenario: enqueue fails → retry blocked → job lost

  Fix: Move SETNX after all writes OR use Redis pipeline
  Priority: IMMEDIATE

---

BLOCKER 2: Non-Atomic Writes (HIGH-1)
  Issue:  3 independent Redis ops, any can fail leaving inconsistent state
  Impact: Job in queue but data missing, or vice versa
  Sequence: hset(old) + hset(new) + rpush not atomic

  Fix: Wrap all 3 ops in redis.pipeline()
  Priority: IMMEDIATE

---

BLOCKER 3: Silent Divergence (HIGH-2)
  Issue:  update_status has no error handling for dual-write
  Impact: Old and new schema get out of sync silently
  Scenario: Old key updated, new key fails, no error raised

  Fix: Add try/catch + logging + telemetry for new schema update
  Priority: IMMEDIATE

================================================================================
SEVERITY BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

CRITICAL (Data Loss):  1 issue
  - CRITICAL-1: Idempotency blocks retries

HIGH (Correctness):    3 issues
  - HIGH-1: Non-atomic writes
  - HIGH-2: Silent divergence
  - HIGH-3: Queue consistency if rpush fails

MEDIUM (Quality):      5 issues
  - MEDIUM-1: Telemetry import in method (performance)
  - MEDIUM-2: Fallback has no observability
  - MEDIUM-3: workspace_id not validated (edge case)
  - MEDIUM-4: Test coverage gaps (10 missing tests)
  - MEDIUM-5: list_jobs doesn't scan new schema

LOW (Nice-to-have):    2 issues
  - LOW-1: Telemetry only for enqueue

TOTAL: 11 issues (3 blockers, 8 improvements)

================================================================================
MUST FIX BEFORE MERGE (3 Issues, 3-4 hours)
================================================================================

1. Idempotency Check Blocks Retries (CRITICAL-1)
   File: src/queue/simple_queue.py:71-77, 115-139

2. Non-Atomic Multi-Step Writes (HIGH-1)
   File: src/queue/simple_queue.py:96-111

3. update_status Missing Error Handling (HIGH-2)
   File: src/queue/simple_queue.py:208-214

================================================================================
SHOULD FIX BEFORE CANARY (5 Issues, 3-4 hours)
================================================================================

4. Workspace_ID Validation (MEDIUM-3)
5. Move Telemetry Import (MEDIUM-1)
6. Add Test Coverage (MEDIUM-4, 10 tests)
7. Queue Consistency Monitoring (HIGH-3)
8. Fallback Observability (MEDIUM-2)

================================================================================
TESTING STATUS
================================================================================

Current Tests: 5/5 passing (100%)
Missing Tests: 10+ (error scenarios, edge cases)

Validation: All 3 blockers confirmed with test reproductions
  File: /tmp/test_critical_issues.py
  Each blocker has dedicated test demonstrating failure mode

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENGINEERS
================================================================================

1. Read detailed analysis: SPRINT_60_PHASE_1_CODE_REVIEW.md
2. Read fix guide: SPRINT_60_PHASE_1_FIX_GUIDE.md
3. Implement fixes in order (3-4 hours):
   - FIX 1: Idempotency (move SETNX) [1-2 hours]
   - FIX 2: Atomicity (use pipeline) [1-2 hours]
   - FIX 3: Error handling (try/catch) [1 hour]
4. Add missing tests (2-3 hours):
   - 10 new test cases with code samples provided
5. Run full test suite (30+ tests should pass)
6. Resubmit PR with all fixes + test results
7. Schedule re-review (2-3 hours)

Total Timeline: 8-10 hours (fix + test + review)

================================================================================
RISK ASSESSMENT IF DEPLOYED WITHOUT FIXES
================================================================================

Data Loss Risk:         HIGH
  - Retries blocked by stale idempotency keys
  - Jobs lost without recovery mechanism

Consistency Risk:       HIGH
  - Old and new schema can diverge
  - Reads return non-deterministic results

Production Impact:      MEDIUM-HIGH
  - Affects all new jobs with flag=on
  - Silent failures (no alerts by default)

Overall Assessment: HIGH RISK - Do not deploy

================================================================================
DEPLOYMENT DECISION
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE:  Not ready
NEXT STEP:      Fix blockers + add tests
GATE REVIEW:    Required after fixes
STAGING:        After gate review approval
CANARY:         Only if staging tests pass
PRODUCTION:     Only if canary stable 48 hours

DO NOT DEPLOY without all 3 blockers fixed.

REVIEW METADATA
================================================================================

Reviewer: Code Review Agent (Haiku 4.5)
Review Date: 2025-10-17 10:15 UTC
Files Analyzed: 4 core files + related tests
Issues Identified: 11 total (3 blockers)
Issues Validated: 3/3 blockers confirmed with test reproductions
Confidence Level: HIGH

================================================================================
FINAL STATEMENT
================================================================================

Sprint 60 Phase 1 implementation has good architecture and backward
compatibility, but contains 3 critical blocking issues that can cause
data loss and inconsistency.

All 3 issues are straightforward to fix (4-5 hours engineering + 2-3
hours testing). After fixes and tests added, implementation will be
production-ready.

Recommendation: Fix blockers, add tests, re-review, then proceed.
