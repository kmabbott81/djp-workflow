**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 Complete — Ready for Canary Testing
**Branch**: `sprint-60/s60-dual-write-migration`
**Base**: v0.1.4 (Sprint 59 Slice 05 hotfix)
**Commits**: 2 commits (6ab097b, ca0c578)

---

## Phase 1 Implementation Summary

### Goal
Implement zero-downtime dual-write migration from flat Redis key schema (`ai:jobs:{job_id}`) to workspace-scoped hierarchical schema (`ai:job:{workspace_id}:{job_id}`).

### Status: ✅ Complete

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Feature Flag
- **File**: `.env.example`
- **Flag**: `AI_JOBS_NEW_SCHEMA=off` (default: disabled)
- **Description**: Controls dual-write behavior
  - `off` (default): Writes to old schema only (backward compatibility)
  - `on`: Writes to BOTH old and new schemas (migration mode)

### 2. Dual-Write Logic (`src/queue/simple_queue.py`)

#### SimpleQueue.enqueue()
- **Lines 44-139**: Dual-write implementation
- **Behavior**:
  - Always writes to old key: `ai:jobs:{job_id}`
  - When flag=on: Also writes to new key: `ai:job:{workspace_id}:{job_id}`
  - **Atomicity**: Both writes succeed or fail together with cleanup on error
  - **Telemetry**: Records `ai_jobs_dual_write_total` (workspace_id, result)
- **Error Handling**:
  - Try/catch around both writes
  - Cleanup of partial writes on failure
  - Telemetry records succeeded/failed attempts

#### SimpleQueue.get_job()
- **Lines 141-175**: Read-with-fallback implementation
- **Behavior**:
  - When flag=on AND workspace_id provided: Tries new key first
  - Falls back to old key if not found in new schema
  - When flag=off: Reads from old key only (original behavior)

#### SimpleQueue.update_status()
- **Lines 177-214**: Dual-update implementation
- **Behavior**:
  - Always updates old key
  - When flag=on AND workspace_id provided: Also updates new key if exists
  - Idempotent: Only updates if key already exists (no orphan creates)

### 3. Telemetry (`src/telemetry/prom.py`)

#### New Metric
- **Metric**: `ai_jobs_dual_write_total` (Counter)
- **Labels**: `workspace_id`, `result` (succeeded | failed)
- **Description**: Tracks dual-write attempts for schema migration monitoring
- **Lines**:
  - 75: Global declaration
  - 106: init_prometheus() global
  - 343-347: Metric definition
  - 602: Export
  - 706-719: `record_dual_write_attempt()` recording function

### 4. Tests (`tests/test_dual_write.py`)

#### New Test File (166 lines)
- **5 tests total**, all passing:
  1. `test_enqueue_writes_only_old_schema_when_flag_off` — Verifies backward compatibility (flag=off)
  2. `test_get_job_reads_from_old_schema_when_flag_off` — Verifies read path when flag=off
  3. `test_enqueue_writes_both_schemas_when_flag_on` — Verifies dual-write when flag=on
  4. `test_get_job_reads_new_schema_first_when_flag_on` — Verifies new-schema-first read with fallback
  5. `test_update_status_writes_both_schemas_when_flag_on` — Verifies status updates to both schemas

#### Test Infrastructure
- Uses `fakeredis` for Redis mocking (no real Redis required)
- Patches `ENABLE_NEW_SCHEMA` flag for controlled testing
- Mocks telemetry to verify recording calls

### 5. Bug Fix (`tests/test_jobs_endpoint.py`)

#### Issue
- 11 tests failing with 401 Unauthorized (auth decorator applied at module load)

#### Fix (commit 6ab097b)
- Use `relay_sk_demo_preview_key` (Sprint 55 Week 3 feature) via TestClient headers
- Bypasses database auth for testing (Sprint 55 authentication method)
- All 12 endpoint tests now passing

### 6. Redis Compatibility Fix (`src/queue/simple_queue.py`)

#### Issue
- Redis hset() rejects None values (DataError)

#### Fix
- Line 88: Changed `"result": None` to `"result": ""` (empty string)
- Maintains compatibility with existing deserializer logic

## Test Results

### Critical Test Suite: 30/30 Passing ✅

```bash
tests/test_dual_write.py .....                                           [ 16%]
tests/test_jobs_endpoint.py ............                                 [ 56%]
tests/test_job_tracking.py ..........                                    [ 90%]

============================= 30 passed in 2.48s ==============================
```

**Breakdown**:
- **5 dual-write tests** (new) — 100% passing
- **12 /ai/jobs endpoint tests** — 100% passing (was 11 failing, now fixed)
- **10 job tracking tests** — 100% passing (existing)
- **3 job orchestrator integration tests** — 100% passing (existing)

### Test Coverage

| Scenario | Flag State | Test | Status |
|----------|-----------|------|--------|
| Backward compatibility | off | Writes to old schema only | ✅ |
| Backward compatibility | off | Reads from old schema | ✅ |
| Dual-write | on | Writes to both schemas | ✅ |
| Read fallback | on | Tries new first, falls back to old | ✅ |
| Status updates | on | Updates both schemas | ✅ |

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Always Write to Old Schema**
- **Rationale**: Backward compatibility for existing workers/readers
- **Impact**: No breaking changes during migration
- **Trade-off**: Extra Redis write (acceptable for Phase 1)

### 2. **New Schema First for Reads**
- **Rationale**: Validates new schema works before full cutover
- **Impact**: Tests new key pattern in production (with fallback safety)
- **Trade-off**: Extra Redis read if new key doesn't exist (Phase 1 only)

### 3. **Feature Flag at Module Level**
- **Rationale**: Module-level constant avoids per-request overhead
- **Impact**: Requires restart to toggle flag (acceptable for phased rollout)
- **Alternative Considered**: Request-level flag (rejected for performance)

### 4. **Telemetry on Success Only**
- **Rationale**: Reduces noise, focuses on migration progress
- **Impact**: Can track % of jobs on new schema via Prometheus
- **Dashboard Query**: `ai_jobs_dual_write_total{result="succeeded"} / ai_jobs_total`

### 5. **Cleanup on Error**
- **Rationale**: Prevents orphan keys in new schema during failures
- **Impact**: Maintains consistency (both keys exist or neither)
- **Idempotency**: Safe to retry failed enqueues

---

## Deviations from Plan

### None
Phase 1 implementation matches the plan in `SPRINT_60_HANDOFF.md` and `RECOMMENDED_PATTERNS_S60_MIGRATION.md` exactly.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Module-Level Flag**: Requires restart to enable/disable dual-write
   - **Mitigation**: Use canary deployments with different flag values
   - **Phase 2 Note**: Consider request-level flag if dynamic toggling needed

2. **No Backfill**: Existing jobs remain in old schema only
   - **By Design**: Phase 2 will implement async backfill
   - **Current State**: New jobs get dual-written, old jobs stay in old schema

3. **No Cleanup of Old Schema**: Old keys persist indefinitely
   - **By Design**: Phase 4 (30 days after Phase 3) will clean up old keys
   - **Current State**: Both schemas coexist (expected for Phase 1)

---

## Security Review

### ✅ Sprint 59 Security Posture Maintained
- No changes to authentication/authorization logic
- No new external API calls
- No new secrets or credentials
- Workspace isolation maintained (workspace_id in new key pattern)
- Telemetry labels bounded (workspace_id validated by existing canonical_workspace_id())

### ✅ Phase 1-Specific Security
- **Atomicity**: Both writes succeed or fail together (no partial state)
- **Idempotency**: Safe to retry failed enqueues (existing SETNX logic preserved)
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to client, detailed logging internally
- **No Injection Risk**: workspace_id validated by existing validation (src/telemetry/prom.py:494-517)

---

## Performance Impact

### Expected Latency Increase: <5%
- **Old Schema Write**: ~0.5ms (1 Redis hset + 1 rpush)
- **New Schema Write**: +0.5ms (1 additional Redis hset)
- **Total**: ~1.0ms (2 hsets + 1 rpush)
- **Read Path**: +0.5ms if new key not found (fallback to old)

### Mitigation
- Phase 2 will eliminate fallback overhead (100% traffic to new schema)
- Phase 4 will remove dual-write overhead (single write to new schema)

### Monitoring
- Use `ai_job_latency_seconds{workspace_id}` to track actual impact
- Alert if p99 latency increases >10%

---

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1 Canary (Current State — AI_JOBS_NEW_SCHEMA=on)

1. **Deploy to Staging** (Day 1)
   - Set `AI_JOBS_NEW_SCHEMA=on` in staging environment
   - Run integration tests (30 tests passing)
   - Manual smoke test: Create job, verify both keys exist in Redis
   - Monitor `ai_jobs_dual_write_total{result="succeeded"}` metric

2. **Deploy to Canary** (Day 2)
   - Deploy to 10% of production workers with flag=on
   - Monitor for 24 hours:
     - `ai_jobs_dual_write_total{result="failed"}` should be 0
     - `ai_job_latency_seconds{workspace_id}` p99 should stay <110% of baseline
     - No errors in logs containing "dual-write"
   - Compare old vs new key data via Redis dumps (validate consistency)

3. **Full Production** (Day 3, if canary stable)
   - Deploy to 100% of production workers with flag=on
   - Monitor for 48 hours before Phase 2

### Phase 1 Rollback Procedure

If dual-write failures occur:
1. Set `AI_JOBS_NEW_SCHEMA=off` in production config
2. Restart all workers (flag is module-level)
3. Old schema remains intact (backward compatibility preserved)
4. Investigate failures, fix issue, retry Phase 1 deployment

**Data Loss Risk**: None (old schema always written)
